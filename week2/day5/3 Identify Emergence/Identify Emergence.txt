One unexpected behavior I’ve seen is players stacking objects to climb over walls that were meant to block progress. 
This happened because the game’s physics system allowed objects to keep their collision and weight realistically, and
the designers didn’t limit how objects could be stacked. Players creatively used these systems in a way the developers
didn’t originally intend.
