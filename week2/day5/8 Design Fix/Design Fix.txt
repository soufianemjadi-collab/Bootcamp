Idea for a Balancing Loop:

Introduce scaling enemy difficulty: as the player’s level or power increases, enemies become stronger, smarter, or more numerous. This reduces the player’s rate of easy progression,
slowing down power growth and keeping the game challenging, creating a balancing loop that prevents players from becoming overpowered too quickly.
