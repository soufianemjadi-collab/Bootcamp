Loop Example: XP and Leveling in an RPG

When a player earns experience points (XP) by defeating enemies or completing quests, they gain levels, which makes their character stronger. 
This increased strength allows them to defeat tougher enemies more easily, earning even more XP. This is a reinforcing loop, because each cycle
amplifies the player’s progress and power over time.
