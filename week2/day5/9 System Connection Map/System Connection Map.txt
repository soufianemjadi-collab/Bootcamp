Systems: Combat and Economy

When players defeat enemies (combat system), they often collect materials, weapons, or rupees (economy system). The items earned can be sold or used to upgrade gear, 
which strengthens the player, making future combat easier. Conversely, the economy influences combat because having better weapons and resources allows players to tackle 
stronger enemies, creating a mutual influence between the two systems.
