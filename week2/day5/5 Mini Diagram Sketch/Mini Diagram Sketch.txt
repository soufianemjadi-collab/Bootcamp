Reputation system (RPG or open-world game):
The source of reputation points comes from completing quests, helping NPCs, or making choices that favor a faction. The stock is the player’s current reputation
level with that faction, often shown numerically or with a rating. The sink is negative actions, such as attacking allies, breaking rules, or failing missions, 
which reduce reputation.
