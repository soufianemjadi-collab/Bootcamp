Real-life system: Traffic

When traffic becomes congested, drivers slow down, which causes even more congestion behind them (a reinforcing feedback loop). In response, some drivers choose
alternative routes or travel atdifferent times, which can reduce congestion on the main road (a balancing feedback loop). Traffic lights adjust their timing based 
on car flow, helping regulate movement and prevent jams from getting worse.
