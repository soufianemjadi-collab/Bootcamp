Example of Emergence: Minecraft

Players sometimes use lava and water to create “infinite obsidian generators” or trap enemies in complex contraptions. This behavior is surprising because the 
game never explicitly tells players to combine fluids this way. The emergent behavior arises from the interaction of multiple systems: physics (liquid flow), 
crafting (obsidian blocks), and AI (enemy movement), which together allow creative solutions or exploits that the developers didn’t directly design.
